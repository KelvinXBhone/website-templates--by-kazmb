            These are referred to as height-adjustable desks, or sit-stand desks.Although research is still in early stages, it does appear that using a standing desk can have impressive benefits for health.          
            At the very least, using this type of desk can partly negate the harmful effects of sitting too much.</p>

    <div class="abouthbcontent1">

        <h3>Benefits of Standing Desk ?</h3>
        <ul>
            <span>Here</span> are the most specific benefits facts of standing desk - 
            <li>Standing Lowers Your Risk of Weight Gain and Obesity</li>
            <p>While exercise is the most effective way to burn calories quickly, simply choosing to stand instead of sitting can also be beneficial.In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has been shown to burn over 170 additional calories.
            That is almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing at your desk each afternoon. This caloric difference could be one of the reasons why sitting longer is so strongly linked to obesity and metabolic disease. </p>

            <li>Standing May Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease</li>
            <p>A study found that bus conductors who stood all day had half the risk of heart disease-related deaths as their colleagues in the driver's seats. Since then, scientists have developed a much greater understanding of the effects of sitting on heart health, with prolonged sedentary time thought to increase the risk of heart disease by up to 147%. It is so harmful that even an hour of intense exercise may not make up for the negative effects of an entire day spent sitting.
            There is no doubt that spending more time on your feet is beneficial for heart health.</p>
            <!-- 3 -->
            <li>Standing Desks Help Improve Mood and Energy Levels</li>
            <p>In one 7-week study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who remained seated the entire work day. Additionally, 87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day. Upon returning to their old desks, overall moods reverted to their original levels. These findings align with broader research on sitting and mental health, which links sedentary time with an increased risk of both depression and anxiety. </p>
